# CS 513 System Software

### Introduction

This repository contains notes and resources for the CS513 System Software course, which was part of my coursework during the 1st Term of my M.Tech program at IIIT Bangalore between 2020-2022. The course was taught by Prof. Thangaraju

### Motivation

Originally, these notes were compiled on my [Notion page](https://shathin.notion.site/CS-513-Software-Systems-eb046e179fca4019bef21dca44f402bc), but I am now migrating them to GitHub. This move aims to open up the content for collaboration from new students and to share this resource with a broader audience. By making this knowledge more accessible, I hope to contribute to the learning journey of others who are exploring this subject.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the content might not be complete as it was created during my time in the M.Tech program, and I havenâ€™t actively maintained it since. Therefore, it is open for collaboration from other students of IIIT, Bengaluru who are interested in contributing to and expanding the content.
